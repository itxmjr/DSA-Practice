# DSA Practice – Structured & Curated

This repository contains my curated Data Structures & Algorithms solutions, 
organized by topic.  
The goal is to build strong problem-solving skills using a clean, 
professional, and structured approach.

## 📌 Structure
- Each topic has its own folder.
  - `explanation.md` (my reasoning + approach)

- Every problem has:
  - `solution.cpp`

## 🧠 Learning Approach
1. Solve using NeetCode Roadmap (NeetCode 150)
2. Re-solve on LeetCode
3. Write a short explanation in my own words
4. Keep the repo clean & curated

## 🚀 Topics Covered
- Arrays
- Two Pointers
- Sliding Window
- Stack
- Binary Search
- Trees
- Graphs
- Dynamic Programming

More coming as I progress.
